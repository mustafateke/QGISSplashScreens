# QGISSplashScreens
A collection of QGIS Splash Screens

I wondered how QGIS (Previously Quantum GIS) version started naming after city names: it was from version 1.7 (Wroclaw) with the exception of my favorite 3.14 "Pi" version. 

They started the splash screen from version 0.3: some pets on maps. Beginning in v0.8 they used the moons of Jupiter such as Titan as version names. 

I made a gif animation of QGIS versions. The latest one is Grenoble
